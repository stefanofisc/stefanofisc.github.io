								I am currently involved in the two following research topic: (i) identification of exoplanets and (ii) observations of comets.
								<br><br>
								<b>Identifying exoplanets by Deep Learning</b>
								<br>
								I approached to this research topic during my MSc studies in 2019. I am focusing on the identification of exoplanets in the data collected by space-based transit surveys 
								like NASA's Kepler and TESS. To this aim, I design both supervised and unsupervised ML algorithms. 
								As of today, the supervised ML algorithm I developed is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This network, 
								which is trained on Kepler and TESS data, achieves appreciable predictive performance as it correctly classifies the 88% of real 
								exoplanets. For further details about this work, the reader may find useful to read the original articles: 
								<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2515-5172/abf56b">Fiscale et al. (2021)</a>,

							<p align="justify">
								<b>Comets Observations</b>
								<br>
								With my supervisor (Prof. Alessandra Rotundi) I am devoting part of my research work in support of the ESA Comet Interceptor mission. 
								More precisely, I am co-investigator of the two projects (PI E. Mazzotta Epifani) listed below:
								<ul>
									<li>Comets beyond 4 au: supporting Comet Interceptor mission by modeling cometary dust production (Asiago Astrophysical Observatory);</li> 
									<li>Observing distant comets in support of the ESA Comet Interceptor mission (Telescopio Nazionale Galileo).</li>
									
								</ul>

								Since February 2022, I am monthly visiting the Asiago Astrophysical Observatory in order to acquire imaging data of certain distant new comets.
								<br>
