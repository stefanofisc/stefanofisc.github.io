								Stefano is enrolled as Ph.D. in <a href="https://www.ersd.uniparthenope.it">UNESCO Chair on Environment, Resource and Sustainable Development</a>
								at <a href="https://www.uniparthenope.it">Parthenope University of Naples</a>, 
								working in the Department of Science and Technology. Currently, he is involved in 
								the development of Machine Learning (ML) methods to identify exoplanets in <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/kepler/">Kepler</a> 
								and <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/tess/">TESS</a> data. He is also the principal observer in the project "Comets beyond 4 au: 
								supporting ESA Comet Interceptor mission by modeling cometary dust production (Asiago)" 
								with Principal Investigator Elena Mazzotta Epifani.
								He obtained his master's degree in Machine Learning and Big Data from Parthenope 
								University of Naples, Italy, in 2022.
								As he is very keen in improving his communication skills, he attended several courses 
								and school either online and in person. More precisely, he obtained certificates of courses 
								completion by <a href="https://masterclasses.nature.com/">Nature Masterclasses</a> and <a href="https://www.science.org/">Science</a>.<br><br>

								His research is devoted to the identification of exoplanets in the data collected by space-based transit surveys 
								like NASA's Kepler and TESS. To this aim, he is developing both supervised and unsupervised ML algorithms. 
								As of today, the supervised ML algorithm he developed is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This network, 
								which is trained on Kepler and TESS data, achieves appreciable predictive performance as it correctly classifies the 88% of real 
								exoplanets. For further details about this work, the reader may find useful to read the original articles:
