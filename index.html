								Stefano is a Machine Learning Engineer at Cyberneid, where he develops and optimize 
								Computer Vision models for real-world applications.
								<br>
								He is a PhD candidate in the International PhD Programme <a href="https://www.ersd.uniparthenope.it">UNESCO Chair on Environment, Resource and Sustainable Development</a>
								at <a href="https://www.uniparthenope.it">Parthenope University of Naples</a>, 
								working in the Department of Science and Technology. His doctoral thesis focused on 
								the development of Machine Learning algorithms for exoplanet detection in <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/kepler/">Kepler</a> 
								and <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/tess/">TESS</a> data. He also served as principal observer in different projects aimed at supporting
								the ESA's Comet Interceptor mission, performing observations at ground-based telescopes: Asiago Copernico and Telescopio Nazionale Galileo.
								<br>
								He obtained his master's degree in Machine Learning and Big Data at Parthenope 
								University of Naples, Italy (July 2022).
								<br>
								As he is very keen in improving his communication skills (e.g. giving talks, effective writing), he attended several courses 
								and schools mainly held by <a href="https://masterclasses.nature.com/">Nature Masterclasses</a> <br><br>

								During my PhD, I developed deep learning and diffusion-based models to identify planetary signals 
								in stellar light curves, with peer-reviewed publications in high-impact journals. 
								<br>
								I have collaborated with international teams, including NASA’s TESS Collaboration, Planet Patrol, 
								and the Planetary Systems group at the Laboratoire d’Astrophysique de Marseille, where I spent a 
								three months research stay.
								<br>
								I will soon contribute to the ESA/PLATO mission within the Core Science (PSM) Exoplanet Working Group.

							<p align="justify">
								<b>(ii) Comets observation</b>
								<br>
								As part of the research group supporting ESA’s Comet Interceptor mission, I conducted photometric 
								observations of comets using the Copernico Telescope (Asiago, Italy) and the Telescopio Nazionale 
								Galileo (La Palma, Canary Islands), contributing to data reduction and analysis.
